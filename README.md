#Data Management Plan for GRAD521

##Context for the DMP: 
The basic research question I have been working on is what the association between is 4 different accelerometry metrics. Vector magnitude activity counts (VMNF), Euclidean norm minus one (ENMO). Mean amplitude deviation (MAD) and monitor independent movement summary (MIMS) units. In accelerometer data collected during the objective physical activity measurement of the 2011-2014 cycles of the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) all of the accelerometry metrics are used. This has frustrated the field of physical activity measurement and epidemiology due to some labs only being equipped or familiar with one metric of monitoring accelerometer based physical activity. So the raw accelerometer data from approximately 20,000 individuals from the 2011-214 NHANES assessed with correlation associations.
